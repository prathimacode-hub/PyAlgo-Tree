# Tower of Hanoi

Tower of Hanoi is a mathematical game or puzzle consisting of three rods and a number of disks of various diameters, which can slide onto any rod. The puzzle begins with the disks stacked on one rod in order of decreasing size, the smallest at the top, thus approximating a conical shape.<br>
### Rules to be followed while solving the problem:
- Only one disk may be moved at a time.
- Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the stacks and placing it on top of another stack or on an empty rod.
- No disk may be placed on top of a disk that is smaller than it.

### Requirements:
Before running the file, please make sure that you install turtle in your system. 
``` pip install turtle ``` 

### File naming:
- toh.py: solves tower of hanoi using recursion 
- hanoi.py: gives a demonstration of tower of hanoi using turtle graphics

To further contribute to the file, you can try adding inputs to the turtle module so that the number of discs are not fixed
