# Caesar_Cipher

## Aim

The aim is to build a Caesar Cipher Algorithm


## Purpose

To create a Encryption/Decryption program which uses Caesar Cipher Substitution Technique


## Short description of package/script

- The problem is solved using Caesar Substitution algorithm
- We use Python libraries Random while encryption


## Workflow of the Project

Description of functions used in the code and their purpose:

decrypt --> Method for decrypting the inputted encrypted code
In this the user inputs a string , which is supposed to be in encrypted format.
This function uses the key value provided by the user to use caesar substitution method to decrypt the input string

encrypt --> Method to encrypt the input string
In this the user inputs a string , the encrypt function encrypts the inputted string.
This function uses the key value provided by the user to use caesar substitution method to encrypt the input string.
Also after the encryption we have used the random library to disorder the encrypted code , randomly in terms of upper and lower case.



After the desired choice is entered by the user, the  functions gain control and process accordingly


## Compilation Steps

After the script is run, enter:

1. Choose what you want to do encrypt or decrypt
2. If the user chooses 1 the function encrypts the inputted string using encrypt function
3. The user is prompt to enter key value and string .Then the the parameters are passed to the encrypt function which then encrypt it.
4. If the user chooses 2 the function decrypts the inputted string using decrypt function.
5. The user is prompt to enter key value and string .Then the the parameters are passed to the decrypt function which then decrypt it.
6. Lastly , the required output is print.
