<h2> 📌Repository</h2>

This project aims to be a finest hub of various data structures and algorithms you need to know in python across different topics and fields.  

You can get all the wisdom here about data structures and algorithms before you dive into real time projects. Let's get a short intro to it.


## 📍Data Structures & Algorithms

Data structures & Algorithms are an essential part of programming. It comes under the fundamentals of computer science. It gives us the advantage of writing better and efficient code in less time. It's a key topic when it comes to Software Engineering. So as developers, we must have knowledge of Data Structure and Algorithms


## 📍Data Structures

In computer science, a data structure is a data organization, management, and storage format that enables efficient access and modification.
Data structure is a way or a format how your data is stored in memory for effecient usage and retrieval.


## 📍Algorithms

An algorithm is a set of instructions that are used to accomplish a task, such as finding the largest number in a list, removing all the red cards from a deck of playing cards, sorting a collection of names, figuring out an average movie rating from just your friend's opinion

Algorithms are not limited to computers. They are like a set of step-by-step instructions or an even a recipe, containing things you need, steps to do, the order to do them, conditions to look for, and expected results.


<h2> 🙌Join Here</h2>

Anyone related to technology who are looking to contribute to open-source, are all invited to hop in. This place has a task for everyone.

If you find this repo useful or it did help you in enhancing your python knowledge, do share it with the world so that others can get benefitted as you did.  

<h3> Language - Python</h3>

Are you new to Python? You can gain strong foundations on Basic Python through this [repo](https://github.com/prathimacode-hub/Learn-Python-For-Beginners).

To make your learning journey more fruitful, I had created an open source project of [Awesome Python Scripts](https://github.com/prathimacode-hub/Awesome_Python_Scripts). Do add your projects to enhance your learning experience. It has everything to offer for you and is a one stop place for all kinds of python scripts.

Drop me a private message, if this project enriched your skills better and made you progress in building up your own projects in python. Any queries, feel free to ask. I would be happy to assist you.

* If you have modified/added code, make sure the code compiles before submitting.
* Strictly use snake_case (underscore_separated) in your file_name and push it in the correct folder.
* Add detailed comments and explain the script elaborately with test cases to help us know what the Script is all about.
* Do not update the **[README.md](https://github.com/prathimacode-hub/PyAlgo-Tree/blob/main/README.md).**
