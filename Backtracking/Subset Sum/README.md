# Subset Sum

## Aim

From a list of integers, the aim is to check and return a set of integers whose sum will be equal to the target value K.


## Purpose

The purpose is to solve this problem using backtracking.


## Short description of package/script

- The user provides the list of integers and target value K.
- Recursively, multiple subsets (combinations of integers) are made.
- If the desired value is reached, the subset gets printed.


## Workflow of the Project

Description of functions used in the code and their purpose:

Subset_Sum --> Main Recursive function to find the desired Subset Sum.

In every consequent iteration, each integer gets subtracted from target value and gets added to a (temporary) subset.


## Compilation Steps

After the script is run, enter:

1. The list of integers.
2. The target value.

That's it! If a valid subset exists, it will get printed.
