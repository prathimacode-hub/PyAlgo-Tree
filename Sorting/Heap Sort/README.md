<!--## Heap Sort

### Algorithm
1. Build a max heap from the input data. 
2. At this point, the largest item is stored at the root of the heap. Replace it with the last item of the heap followed by reducing the size of heap by 1. Finally, heapify the root of the tree. 
3. Repeat step 2 while the size of the heap is greater than 1.

### Language Used : Python

### The overall time complexity of Heap Sort is O(nLogn).

### Sample Testcases

**Input**                         
5 4 3 2 1  
**Output**  
1 2 3 4 5

**Input**  
31 4 12 4  
**Output**  
4 4 12 31

# Package/Script Name

## Aim

To write code for sorting the numbers using Heap Sort.


## Purpose

To know about Heap sort Algorithm and its live example on inputs.


## Short description of package/script

Code is written in python language and takes input list of numbers of any length and output is the sorted array using Heap Sort.


## Detailed explanation of script, if needed

1. Build a max heap from the input data. 
2. At this point, the largest item is stored at the root of the heap. Replace it with the last item of the heap followed by reducing the size of heap by 1. Finally, heapify the root of the tree. 
3. Repeat step 2 while the size of the heap is greater than 1.


## Setup instructions

Explain how to setup and run your package/script in user's system


## Compilation Steps

clone the repository and extract the files and run the code in compiler and give input.
