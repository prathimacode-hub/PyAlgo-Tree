# Expression Tree Evaluation 


## Aim

The aim is to create a python code to evaluate an expression tree using recursion

## Purpose

The purpose is to come up with an efficient solution while implementing recursion (if any)

## Short description of project

The project takes in input the expression tree to be checked, 
and then checks the evaluated the from the root node, bu recursively calling its left and right subtrees.

## Workflow of the Project

Description of functions used in the code and their purpose:

Node --> Class to define each node of the tree

expression_tree_evaluation --> recursive method to evaluate expression tree

After the root node of the tree is passed to the function, the control is passed to the isPalindrome function, which returns the evaluated value, 
which is then printed with an appropriate output to the user.

## Required libraries

None

## Compilation Steps
Run the script, after that :

 1. The expression tree is made manually here, to focus on evaluation part 
 2. The program tells the value of the expression calculated from the tree
