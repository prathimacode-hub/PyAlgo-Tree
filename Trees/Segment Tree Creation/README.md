# Segment tree Creation


## Aim

The aim is to create a python code to create a segment tree of a given array of numbers

## Purpose

The purpose is to come up with an efficient solution (if any)

## Short description of project

The project takes in input the array whose segment tree needs to be created, 
and then it parses through the array, summing the array elements, creating the tree.
The resultant segment tree is then returned and printed.

## Workflow of the Project

Description of functions used in the code and their purpose:

segment_tree_creation --> Function, takes in a list, returns corresponding segment tree

After the list is passed to the segment_tree_creation function, control is passed to that function, it uses the iterative approach to generate the segment tree and returns it, 
which is then printed with a proper output by the driver code.

## Required libraries

math library --> for ceil and log2 functions 

## Compilation Steps
Run the script, after that :

 1. The expression is made manually here, to focus on conversion part 
 2. The program tells the equivalent segment tree
